# Car Plate Detection

## Introduction
Welcome to our GitHub repository, where we've developed an advanced vehicle tracking and license plate recognition system designed to address the challenges of efficient traffic control, surveillance, and recovery of stolen vehicles. This project leverages cutting-edge deep learning strategies to overcome the complexities of license plate recognition, including variations in background, font color, style, size, and non-standard characters often encountered in developing countries.
Our system is trained and validated on a diverse dataset captured under various lighting conditions, distances, angles, and rotations, ensuring high recognition rates even in the most challenging scenarios. It aims to serve as a valuable tool for law enforcement agencies and private organizations, enhancing homeland security measures.
The repository contains all the necessary code, models, and documentation to deploy and test the system. We invite collaborators to contribute towards further innovations, including the integration of hybrid classifier methods and enhancements for robust performance across different weather conditions.
## Installation
To install and run our app built with Streamlit and FastAPI, follow these steps:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Start the FastAPI server by running uvicorn main:app --reload in the terminal.
Launch the Streamlit app by executing streamlit run app.py.
Ensure you have Python installed and are using a virtual environment for better dependency management. This setup will get the app running locally for development and testing purposes.
